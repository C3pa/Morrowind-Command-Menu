# Command Menu

This mod adds a command menu. The menu is opened by pressing a key combination (Alt + C by default) while in-game. The menu has many features:
 - General tab - various things to tweak: engine settings, enabling/disabling certain Morrowind mechanics, crime & security tweaking, tweaking passage of time and current weather, and miscellaneous commands.
 - Player tab - change the player's primary and derived attributes and skills
 - Items tab - choose items to add to the player's inventory
 - Spells tab - choose spells to learn
 - Soul Gems tab - add filled soul gems to the player's inventory
 - Teleport tab - a menu for teleporting to a given cell or a chosen NPC
 - Factions tab - manage faction membership and rank
 - Quests tab - step through each quest stage
 - In addition, the mod also has a feature for picking the landscape texture the player is looking at. This feature is unbound by default. To use it, go to the mod's MCM menu and bind it to certain key combinations. Pressing this key combo will show the name of the ground texture the player is looking at.

These features make it useful for testing, and making mods.

You can think of this mod as a spiritual successor to the great Cheat Menu mod by qqqbbb. While this mod doesn't inherit any code from it, it was inspired by it, and for it, qqqbbb has my thanks. The motivation was to make something similar that would be less sluggish. This mod will do as much work as it can during loading. Waiting for the menu to open in this mod is only once on the first opening of the menu. After that, the subsequent openings are instant. Note that the number of items and spells in Morrowind, and more so in modded installs, can make the Items and Spells tab a bit laggy. That's the reason why those tabs are empty by default and only start listing items/spells after some search text is entered.

## Usage
